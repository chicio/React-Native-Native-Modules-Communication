[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chicio/React-Native-Native-Modules-Communication/master/LICENSE.md)

An example project in which I describe a simple architecture for communication between React Native Native Modules 
(usually called bridges) and the Native UIViewController/Activity/Fragment that host the React Native component. 
Generally speaking the architecture shown in this project is useful to let the Native Modules communicate with your 
existing native codebase.
This is a project for my blog posts:
